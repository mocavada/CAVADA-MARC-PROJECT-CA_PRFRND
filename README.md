# 🧱 PROJECT 1 — Programming Fundamentals Project  
### Inventory Management System  
**Student:** Marc Cavada  
**Course:** CA_PFRND  
**Instructor:** [Instructor Name]  
**Session:** 11–15

## 🎯 INTRODUCTION

This project simulates an **Inventory Management System**, allowing users to:
1. Insert new items  
2. Display a specific item by ID  
3. Display all items  
4. Exit the program  

The main focus is **logic, functionality, and structure**, not design or UI.  
All data is stored temporarily in memory during runtime (no database or file storage).

## 🧠 OBJECTIVES

- Interpret and implement project specifications  
- Design and code based on logic and requirements  
- Apply programming constructs (loops, conditions, error handling)  
- Use C# within Visual Studio IDE  
- Validate logic with test data  
- Implement structured and readable source code
